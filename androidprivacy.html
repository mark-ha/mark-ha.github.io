<h2>Mark Harman - Privacy policy</h2>

<p>This privacy policy covers applications (Vibrance HDR, Hexabots) developed by Mark Harman.</p>

<p>Vibrance HDR requests storage permission (at least for Android&trade; 9 and earlier) in order to open recent images, and save resultant images to your device.</p>

<p>Some of my applications for Android&trade; (Hexabots; and Vibrance HDR v1.11 or earlier) include advertising served via the Google Mobile Ads SDK (also known as Admob), and
    Google Analytics for Firebase. These use identifiers for mobile devices (including Android Advertising ID),
    cookies and similar technologies, including to serve personalised ads.
    You can view or edit your ad settings, or opt out of personalized advertising, via <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/settings/ads">Google's Ads Settings ( https://www.google.co.uk/settings/ads )</a>.</p>

<!-- see https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6048248 , https://support.google.com/admob/answer/7676680 ,
    https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads -->
<p><b>Update: </b> I have now instructed Google to not display personalised ads (although note that Admob may still use the
Android advertising identifier for serving even non-personalised ads).</p>

<p>Also see <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/partner-sites/">"How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services"</a> and
<a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245">Google Analytics Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<p>Since my applications also use operating system APIs, you should review relevant privacy policies
    such as for your device, manufacturer, operating system and/or Google accounts.</p>

<p>If you have inquiries about my privacy policy, please contact me by email at mark.harman.apps@gmail.com .</p>
